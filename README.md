# Wireless Earbuds Wire Management
Were you like me and got a pair of wireless earbuds so you _finally_ run out of
excues to skip the gym?

Then you realize that the wire was _wayy_too long, and that there was no way
that you could run with that!

So instead of tying a knot and going to the gym, I opted to stay inside in my
room and program this model, fueled with nothing other than doritos and orange
juice.

Its a simple 3 wire holder, and should work with all round wires (unlike the 
Beats.) Tested on teh Anker Soundbuds Slim.
